# Hangman-Game-Python

# Note:
The reason why I decided to program this game was to keep practicing and improve my comprehension of list abilities and programming logic. With this type of game, you will find yourself in a position to figure out plenty of logic issues along the way. You will function with concepts like enumerating and indexing elements, logical positioning, and ordering to build the world and lists, similar to the function 'join'."
